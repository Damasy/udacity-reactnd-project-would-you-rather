# Would You Rather Project

This project was created as a part of Udacity cource, to practise playing with redux as a single source of truth 

  - To see available questions you need to login first by choosing one of the users
  - Then user can answer any unanswered question or view answered question
  - User also can create new poll that let all users choose between two options 
  - User also can go to leader board to see users ordered with their questions and answers count 

## Running Project

After downloading repo, you can run:

### `npm install`

To download node modules then run:
### `npm start`

That launchs your localhost on home 


**Note: This project has no real backend so it saves data per session so test all functionalities without refreshing page, even logging in with another user **
